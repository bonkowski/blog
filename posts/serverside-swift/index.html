                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>I came over this <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/3858252-how-to-think-in-server-side-swift">article</a> today, which got my attention since I spent a few hours yesterday evening to see what options we currently have for Swift on the backend. I like the idea since Swift is a very nice programming language.</p>

<p>The project I wanted to use to explore Swift on the server-side is to replicate the functionality we already got in a &ldquo;mock-server&rdquo; written in Go. This server simulates most of the features that our production servers provide, which helps us when developing our iOS and Android apps.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on my 24th year as a professional developer, and I have mainly worked on backends using JVM based languages such as Java, and later Clojure and Kotlin. In the Java days, we often had to use the Spring Framework, which I never want to do again. I have also worked with a couple of Ruby on Rails projects, and while it was fun and productive, especially in the beginning, is also something I don&rsquo;t want to go back to.</p>

<p>My two latest backend projects used Clojure and Kotlin. In Clojure, we do not use frameworks (I don&rsquo;t think it even exists), but we prefer small and focused libraries that do one thing only but does it well.</p>

<p>At my last backend project, where we decided to use Kotlin, the team also agreed to go the &ldquo;Clojure Way&rdquo; and select the best libraries for the different tasks and problems we needed to solve instead of choosing a framework that dictates how to design and implement the project.</p>

<p>What we ended up with was a simple micro web framework called Jooby, which we only use to handle requests and serve content. It would take a minimum of effort to replace Jooby with another similar library. For the rest of the application functionality, we selected a few libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/seratch/kotliquery">Kotlin Query</a> for accessing and using the database and <a href="https://github.com/SalomonBrys/Kotson">Kotson</a> for JSON, and of course, a few more. The most important library (or collection of libraries) we decided to use was <a href="https://arrow-kt.io">Arrow</a> since we wanted to write our code in a functional style.</p>

<p>The project was a great success, it&rsquo;s easy to work with, very testable, and the codebase is surprisingly small. Many developers in the organization I&rsquo;m hired to work for have shown a great interest in how we designed and built the system.</p>

<p>To create my replica of the beforementioned Mock server in Swift, I looked around to see what existed, and I decided to play a little with Vapor. Unfortunately, almost immediately, it gave me a feeling of wearing a straightjacket, and the simple things I wanted to start with was not as simple as I hoped it would be. What I wanted was something like a Swift version of Sinatra.</p>

<p>After a few more Google searches, I found <a href="https://perfect.org">Perfect</a>, which looks a little more like what I want. I have only played around with this framework/library for an hour or so, but then I had a working spike of a feature. I also got a working spike using Vapor, but I got the feeling that I had to fight the framework, instead of getting the help I wanted from it. It&rsquo;s too early to come with a conclusion based on this rather simple feature I implemented, and it&rsquo;s way too early to say if Perfect is the perfect &ldquo;framework&rdquo; for me (nothing is perfect). What I can say is that Perfect seems to give more flexibility than Vapor and Kitura if you want to decide for yourself how to write your application.</p>
