### A little bit about me

My name is Andr√© Bonkowski, and I have been programming professionally since 1994.  During all these years, I have worked with a range of different programming languages, such as Turbo Pascal/Delphi, C/C++, Java, Ruby, Groovy, Javascript, Clojure and ClojureScript, Kotlin, Objective-C, Swift and probably a few more that I have forgotten. 

I have worked both on the backend, on the web and with native apps.

I work at the excellent consultant company Kodemaker, where all of the employees owns equal shares of the company. 

Other than work, I enjoy watching and playing football (soccer) and are a massive Liverpool FC fan.
