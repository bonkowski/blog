      <description>I came over this article today, which got my attention since I spent a few hours yesterday evening to see what options we currently have for Swift on the backend. I like the idea since Swift is a very nice programming language.
The project I wanted to use to explore Swift on the server-side is to replicate the functionality we already got in a &amp;ldquo;mock-server&amp;rdquo; written in Go. This server simulates most of the features that our production servers provide, which helps us when developing our iOS and Android apps.</description>
